OPTION 1
Edit the file SvcInstall.bat and then launch it

OPTION 2
1. Identify the service name [SERVICENAME]
2. Identify the full installation path of the service executable [SVCEXE]. This is "C:\Program Files\Eli Lilly\PIDataReaderApps\PIDataReaderSvc.exe" by default.
3. Indentify the full path to the configuration file [CFGFILE]. Example: D:\Projects\DOTNET\PIDataReaderApps\SampleConfigFiles\config.tags.xml
4. Install as service using the following instruction:
	sc.exe create [SERVICENAME] binPath= "[SVCEXE] -c [CFGFILE] -f none"
5. Open the service console and setup the service
		General
			Startup type: Automatic
		Log On
			Logon as: \EMA\XFDIAOSIPI with appropriate password
 		Recovery
			First failure: Restart the Service
			Second failure: Restart the Service
 			Subsequent failures: Restart the Service
6. Start the service from the service console

NOTES:
- multiple instances of the same service executable can be installed, pointing to different configuration files, provided different service names are specified.
